Hello coders, hope you're having an awesome day.

In this app, I'm going to build a cryptocurrency application that lists all the available cryptos in the market.

The focus of this  tutorial will be mainly on how to fetch information from an API and then displaying it in form of a table to the end user.

There are 2 main parts in this application:

1- First part  to search the name of the cryptocurrency you're looking for. 
2- And second part will display all available cryptos in the market.

First we will fetch all the data from the API and store it inside a state variable and then we will map through all the data and display it in a table.

So the ultimate goal here is wheneveryou search for some specific crypto, the app will be able to filter that and display only the matching results.

You should be familliar with React, functional components, React Hooks (at least the useState hook) Axios and how to work with APIs, not to mention javascript ES6 callback functions, arrow function expressions, template literals for string interpolation,  also array functions are very important like filter map reduce sort.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
